A personal finance app for anyone

- I will release more tabs as I clean PII from the working files.
- I will make installation and setup instructions, and a user manual.

- Download your own copy

- The app has a "Dashboard" tab that acts as a central location to do most of the work.
- The app has "Credit Card Accounts", tabs that allow for tracking all of the transactions on each of your credit cards.
- A "Payment Accounts" tab that supplies the data for the "Account" field on the Dashboard.
